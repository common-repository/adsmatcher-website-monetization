== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= 1. How quickly does it start working? =
The AdsMatcher plugin will start working immediately. However, part of the optimization process is determining the best performing ad format. A certain number of impressions must be served before the system can fully optimize and display the most effective ads.

= 2. How much can I earn? =
Revenue depends on your site traffic, its amount, and its quality. Some of the most important factors are audience GEOs, the share of mobile visitors, traffic sources, the number of page views per visitor, etc...

= 3. When and how will I get paid? =
The minimum payment amount required is $50. Once you have reached $50 in revenue, we will send the amount to your PayPal account according to your payment terms described in your agreement, usually Net 30 days.

= 4. Will the plugin slow down my site? =
No. Unlike others, AdsMatcher supports asynchronous ad loading, so your ad zone will have no impact on page load time.
